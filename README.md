# dynamic_message_introspection

This repo allows dynamic introspection of C and C++ messages.
The package can convert ROS 2 messages into a YAML representation, and convert a YAML representation into ROS 2 messages.

The initial development of this code (with support for C messages) was graciously supported by [Rocos (@rocos.io)](https://www.rocos.io/).
C++ messages support was added by [Christophe BÃ©dard](https://github.com/christophebedard).
